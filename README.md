## Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis


### Problem:

Performing a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis on a dataset containing cancer patient information.
The dataset includes details such as patient demographics, dates of diagnosis, treatment received, and outcomes.


### Info:

- The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
- The data is preprocessed accordingly.
- Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is performed in order to estimate the survival function for the dataset.
- Survival probabilities are calculated over time using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.
- The result is plotted including the censored subjects.


### Bonus:

- Conducting subgroup analyses by stratifying the data based on most relevant attributes and calculate survival probabilities for each subgroup.
